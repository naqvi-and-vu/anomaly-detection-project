# Anomaly Detection Project
By: Mariam Naqvi and Anna Vu

<br>
<br>

Have we ever wondered if there was some abnormalities with Codeup's cohorts and their use of the online curriculum? 
Have we ever wondered what lessons are the most popular to students, even post graduation?
Were there students who didn't use the curriculum much...?

Can't say it was our main thought of the day, but we're still out to find the answers! 

<br>

In this anomaly detection project, we will be exploring Codeup's curriculum access log based off this following email.

*Email to analyst:*


*Hello,*


*I have some questions for you that I need to be answered before the board meeting Thursday afternoon. I need to be able to speak to the following questions. I also need a single slide that I can incorporate into my existing presentation (Google Slides) that summarizes the most important points. My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didn’t think to ask, please include that as well.*

### 1. Project Description

We are going to manipulating data in order to find trends and abnormalities in the Codeup Curriculum Access Log. 
Some features we will be able to look into are date, endpoint, user ID, cohort, IP address, and more!

<br>

### 2. Project Deliverables

As stated in the email, we will need to create a single slide to document our finds similar to an executive summary. We will also be creating a final notebook for review, and of course, reply to the email with our discoveries.

### 3.) Project Questions
 - 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
 - 2. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
 - 3. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
 - 4. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
 - 5. Which lessons are least accessed?
