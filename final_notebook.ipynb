    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to answer questions regarding accessing curriculum logs. The data was acquired from the curriculum logs database, cleaned and manipulated to answer questions. The questions were answered using a combination of pandas manipulation as well as anomaly detection techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tasks for our project were planned using this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/qAGMpGzT/anomaly-detection-project)\n",
    "- Python scripts were used to automate the process of acquiring and preparing the data\n",
    "- The data was cleaned by converting dates to datetime objects, dropping duplicates, encoding new features, renaming columns to be more descriptive\n",
    "- Outliers in the data were analyzed as well as the distributions of variables explored in depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- The square footage, location (latitude and longitude) and number of bedrooms were found to be the best drivers of tax value\n",
    "- Some variables like number of bedrooms and bathrooms were highly correlated with each other \n",
    "- Age of home did not seem to have a significant impact on the tax value of the properties\n",
    "- There were some outliers in the data in square footage and number of bedrooms and bathrooms \n",
    "    - These were handled by using a Robust Scaler to reduce the effect of outliers on the model's performance\n",
    "- The baseline mean's RMSE of 620877USD was utilized as the RMSE to beat\n",
    "    - All models beat this RMSE \n",
    "- The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R squared were utilized as metrics to evaluate a model's performance\n",
    "    - My best model's RMSE was 463791USD and R squared was 44%.\n",
    "    - This improved to an RMSE of 440857USD and R squared of 48% on the test split\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can find the data dictionary detailing all the variables used and created [here](https://github.com/mariamnaqvi/predicting_property_values/blob/main/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our analysis we aimed to answer the following questions. This notebook provides answers to each question and an explanation of how that conclusion was reached."
